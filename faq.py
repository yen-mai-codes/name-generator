From Wikipedia, 05/01/2024: \n
            
In corpus linguistics, part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging or PoS tagging or POST), also 
called *grammatical tagging* is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as 
corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context. 
A simplified form of this is commonly taught to school-age children, in the identification 
of words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc.

The complete POS list can be found on the Penn Treebank Project:
